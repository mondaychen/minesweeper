* Seriously? You need the rules of a Minesweeper game explained here?

## Development


1. install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. install [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): `npm install -g bower && npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. open the dictionary of this repository and run:

```
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

If you want to change any JavaScript or CSS codes, run `grunt watch` in advance to make the changes work. The `grunt` command also starts the watching process.
